    "The resistance against the military junta in Greece (1967-1974) was a period of intense political and social struggle against the authoritarian regime that had seized power through a coup d'état on April 21, 1967.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "The military junta, also known as the Regime of the Colonels, was led by a group of military officers headed by Colonel George Papadopoulos. The junta suspended civil liberties, dissolved political parties, censored the media, and established a repressive regime that suppressed dissent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='R.jpg' height = 200px>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opposition Movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The resistance to the junta took various forms and involved a wide range of groups and individuals. Opposition was not limited to a single faction but included students, intellectuals, left-wing activists, and even some conservative elements that opposed the military rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant events of the resistance occurred in November 1973 at the Athens Polytechnic University. Students staged a massive protest against the junta, demanding an end to the dictatorship and the restoration of democracy. The junta responded with a brutal crackdown, sending in the military to suppress the uprising. The exact number of casualties remains disputed, but the event marked a turning point and increased opposition to the regime both domestically and internationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='novmb1704.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### End of the Junta (1974):\n",
    "\n",
    "The junta's rule came to an end in July 1974 following the Cyprus conflict. A failed attempt by the junta to overthrow the Archbishop Makarios III, the leader of Cyprus, led to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This event weakened the junta's position, and civilian unrest in Greece escalated. On July 23, 1974, the junta collapsed, leading to the restoration of democracy in Greece.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Legacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "The resistance against the military junta is remembered as a pivotal moment in Greek history. The sacrifices made by those who opposed the dictatorship are commemorated annually, especially the events at the Athens Polytechnic University. The struggle against the junta left a lasting impact on Greek society and contributed to a renewed commitment to democratic values and human rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period of the military junta and its subsequent downfall shaped the political landscape of Greece in the years that followed, with a lasting impact on the country's commitment to democracy and political pluralism.\n"
